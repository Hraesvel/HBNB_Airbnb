# Holberton School AirBnb Clone

This Repo is a collection of all the iterations of the Airbnb clone project we had to create throughout the course of 6+ months. Version 4 being the actual last project before the deployment step.

# Projects :building_construction:

## [v1: Models, File system and Static pages](https://github.com/Ostoyae/AirBnB_clone) 

In this step of the project we create the models and a console for the
airbnb project. While at this time we're not using any kind database we
create a file system engine to read/write to a JSON file.

We also create the scaffolding of the static html page which we will later
use as them template for JinJa/Jquery frontend.

## [v2: Mysql, SqlAlchemy and Flask](https://github.com/Ostoyae/AirBnB_clone_v2)
 In this step we we polish up the console and implement a database
engine using SQLAlchemy + MySQL. We then create our first Flask
application withing the static html + jinja to service the frontend.

## [v3: RESTful API](https://github.com/Ostoyae/AirBnB_clone_v3)
This step of the project we learn about implement a REST API server for
the application using Flask.

## [v4: Dynamic Frontend](https://github.com/Ostoyae/AirBnB_clone_v4) :gear:
This step we move away from server side rendering via `jinja` and use
the REST API created in the last step to make the frontend dynamic with
JS/JQuery.

## [Deployment](https://github.com/Ostoyae/HBNB_Airbnb) :airplane: 
Final portion of the Airbnb project, deploy the web application to servers. I took this as an oppertunity to learn to use Puppet Bolt to automate the deployment process.
